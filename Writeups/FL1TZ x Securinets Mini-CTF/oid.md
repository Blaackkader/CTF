### Solution

Oh a .txt this time huhh ,  oid ? what is that , time to search a bit :

An **Object Identifier (OID)** is like a unique ID or "name tag" given to an object, concept, or thing so that it can be recognized and identified clearly around the world.

so if they are identified , we can get their real value back ?? let's search up a bit more for oid converters ? 

BOOM we get this 

[GitHub - m9aertner/oidConverter](https://github.com/m9aertner/oidConverter)

Also , found someone suggesting [CyberChef]([CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/)) our friend :D

Let's go ahead and look for oid in cyberchef :

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Blackkader/CTF/main/Ressources/image_24.png)

So oid can be converted to hex  :O , we use that and we find out the hex values 

, are they still encrypted ????  you can search up what's wrong with string through ai or dcode or multidecoder , etccc

But what you guys don't know  is that **CyberChef** has a powerful operation called **Magic** it can identify the conversions done to your input , so we add oid to hex and magic and see what we get

oid > hex > base 64 > base 32 , that's tiring :c 

we grap our output from cyberchef which is this : 

```

```

But what is this thing ? a quick research will tell us that this is a language called [brainfuck](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Brainfuck) , this language messes around with pointers 

It's basically a stack like this :<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Blackkader/CTF/main/Ressources/image_26.png" title="" alt="" data-align="center">

and the commands are those :

<img title="" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Blackkader/CTF/main/Ressources/image_27.png" alt="" width="581" data-align="center">

Let's search up some brainfuck interpreters online , maybe running the output will get us something

i tried this [Interpreter](https://copy.sh/brainfuck/), when trying to run the code i get this error :

```
Syntax error: Unexpected closing bracket in line 1 char 0.
```

Error in first character ? "]" , if we go back to our table we can say that '[' and ']' are used like loops ! **( we leave the loop only if the last cell in the loop has the value 0 !!)** , so in our output we got a loop end statement without even having anything in the stack ? there's something wrong :/ 

And here comes the help of the description ! 

_don't panic ! look for the "input" and start from there ! good luck_

Input ? in our table "," representes the input , are we supposed iterate through our string until we get our first input ? i don't think so , because even if we do that , the instructions after the first input we see are "]<"

Again , same problem ! maybe by the input , the author means the last one ??? and we start from there ?? then it makes sense ! **the string is reversed !**

We reverse the string and get this : 

```
,>>++++++++++[<++++++>-]<[-<->]<----------[><],>>++++++++[<++++>-]<[-<->]<--------------------------------------------[><],>>+++++++++++++++++[<++++>-]<[-<->]<+++++++++++++++++++[><],>>+++++++++[<++++++>-]<[-<->]<------------------------------[><],>>++++++[<++++++>-]<[-<->]<------------------------------------------------------[><],>>+++++++++++++++++++++++[<+++>-]<[-<->]<------------------------------------------------------[><],>>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++[<++>-]<[-<->]<---------------[><],>>++++++[<++++++>-]<[-<->]<-----------------------------------------------------------[><],>>++++++[<++++++>-]<[-<->]<----------------------------------------[><],>>+++++++++++++[<++++>-]<[-<->]<-----------------------------------------------------------------[><],>>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++[<++>-]<[-<->]<------------------------------------------------------------[><],>>+++++++[<++++++>-]<[-<->]<-----------------------------------------------------[><],>>++++++++++[<++++++>-]<[-<->]<------------------------[><],>>+++++++++++++++++[<++>-]<[-<->]<----------------------------------------------------------------------[><],>>+++++++++++++++++[<++++>-]<[-<->]<+++++++++++++++++++[><],>>+++++++++++++++++[<++>-]<[-<->]<---------------------------------------------------------------------------------[><],>>+++++++++++++++++[<++++>-]<[-<->]<---------------------------[><],>>+++++++++++++++++[<+++>-]<[-<->]<---------------------------------------------------------[><],>>+++++++++++++++++++++++[<++>-]<[-<->]<------[><],>>++++++++[<++++++>-]<[-<->]<--------------------------------------------------------------[><],>>+++++++++++++[<+++>-]<[-<->]<----------------------------------------------------------------[><],>>++++++++[<++++++>-]<[-<->]<---------------------------------------------------------------------[><],>>++++++[<+++++>-]<[-<->]<----------------------[><],>>+++++++++++++++++++[<++>-]<[-<->]<-----------------------------------------------------------------[><],>>+++++++++++++++++++++++[<++>-]<[-<->]<-----[><],>>++++++++[<++++>-]<[-<->]<---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[><]
```

We try to run it again in our interpreter, it is stuck in "running...." , we can assume that there is an endless loop ! time to crack the code like pros , using the help of the command table 

SO we get the input by "," then we move the third cell using  ">>" and we increment the value there "+" 10 times , so we have 10 in the third cell  , then we enter the loop by "[" we return to the first cell by "<"

and we add "+" 6 times , then we go back to the second cell and decrement 1 using "-" so it becomes 10-1=9 , and so on till the third cell becomes 0 and the second cell becomes what ?? becomes 6*10 ! we can draw a bit on our stack ( let's refer to the input by x )

<img title="" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Blackkader/CTF/main/Ressources/image_29.png" alt="" data-align="center" width="316">

after the loop ends we go back to the first cell and enter another loop 

"[-<->]" so we start decrementing from the cell that has 60 and go back to the input and decrement from it as well ! then we return to the second cell that now has 59 ..... we continue on until we have this :

<img title="" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Blackkader/CTF/main/Ressources/image_31.png" alt="" data-align="center" width="294">

after this loop we return to the input cell and we decrement "-" 10 times from it :

<img title="" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Blackkader/CTF/main/Ressources/image_32.png" alt="" data-align="center" width="320">

until we reach this [><] and what is that !!! it literally moves to the second cell then to the first , and the only way to leave the loop is by having the value in the cell set to 0 , and boom our equation : **x-70=0 >>>>> x=70** and guess what else is 70 ? its F

our first character of the flag , we are in the correct path 

**To summarize:** 

<img title="" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Blackkader/CTF/main/Ressources/image_34.png" alt="" width="596" data-align="center">

Now you can crack this using a pen and paper or a python script xD , here is my python script (includes the conversions !):

```python
import base64

def p(ch):
    return ch.find("[")-2
def n(ch):#[p(ch)+4:]
    return ch.find(">")

def m(ch):
    x=ch.rfind("[")-ch.rfind("<")-1
    if ch[ch.rfind("<")+1]=="+":
        x=-x
    return x

def oid_to_hex(oid):

    components = list(map(int, oid.split('.')))


    hex_oid = [(components[0] * 40) + components[1]]


    for component in components[2:]:
        hex_part = []
        while component > 0:
            hex_part.insert(0, component & 0x7f)
            component >>= 7
        hex_oid.extend(hex_part)


    return ''.join(f'{byte:02x}' for byte in hex_oid)
